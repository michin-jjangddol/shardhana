    <h2>🎯 Purpose</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Make AEM accessible to a global engineering community</li>
      <li>Encourage open collaboration in structural analysis software</li>
      <li>Bridge academic research and real-world engineering</li>

    <h2>🚀 Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Our goal is to create a platform that supports designing every structure —  
      not only on Earth, but also in space.  
      Like air, Shardhana should be free and open for everyone.
