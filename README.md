# 🏗️ Shardhana Project

**Shardhana** is an open-source structural analysis software applying the **Applied Element Method (AEM)** for **architectural structural engineering**.  
Launched on **August 15, 2025 — the 80th Korean Liberation Day**, this project aims to combine engineering expertise, open-source collaboration, and modern computing to create accurate, scalable, and innovative tools for simulating and understanding structural behavior.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Make AEM accessible** to a global engineering community  
- **Encourage open collaboration** in structural analysis software development  
- **Bridge academic research and real-world engineering**  
- **Foster innovation** through shared knowledge and tools

---

## 🌟 Project Goals

1. **Develop a core AEM engine** capable of realistic structural simulation under various loads and failure scenarios  
2. **Ensure scalability** from small experimental models to large architectural structures  
3. **Promote open-source culture** in structural engineering  
4. **Provide learning resources** for engineers, students, and researchers to understand AEM and structural mechanics
