# 🏗️ Shardhana Project

**Shardhana** is an open-source structural analysis software applying the **Applied Element Method (AEM)** for **architectural structural engineering**.  
Launched on **August 15, 2025 — the 80th Korean Liberation Day**, this project aims to combine engineering expertise, open-source collaboration, and modern computing to create accurate, scalable, and innovative tools for simulating and understanding structural behavior.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Make AEM accessible** to a global engineering community  
- **Encourage open collaboration** in structural analysis software development  
- **Bridge academic research and real-world engineering**  
- **Foster innovation** through shared knowledge and tools

## 🚀 Vision

Our ultimate goal is to become the starting platform  
for designing every structure — not only on Earth, but across space.  
Like air, it should be free for everyone to use,  
without the cost barriers of specific organizations or corporations.  
Shardhana takes the first step toward this shared, open-source structural analysis platform.  

**🇰🇷 비전 (한국어)**  
우리의 궁극적인 목표는 지구뿐만 아니라 우주에 건설되는  
모든 구조물을 설계할 수 있는 출발 플랫폼이 되는 것입니다.  
공기처럼 누구나 자유롭게, 특정 집단이나 기업의 비용 장벽 없이  
사용할 수 있는 구조해석 환경을 만드는 것 —  
Shardhana는 그 첫걸음을 내딛습니다.

## 🌟 Project Goals

1. **Develop a core AEM engine** capable of realistic structural simulation under various loads and failure scenarios  
2. **Ensure scalability** from small experimental models to large architectural structures  
3. **Promote open-source culture** in structural engineering  
4. **Provide learning resources** for engineers, students, and researchers to understand AEM and structural mechanics
